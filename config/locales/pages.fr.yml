        title: Safety Tips
        subtitle: At La Voyageuse, your safety is our priority. Please read below safety tips carefully before your departure
        tips:
          tip1:
            title: Travel & Medical Insurance
            content: We strongly recommend that you purchase comprehensive travel and medical insurance to cover the country (or countries) that you are traveling in.
          tip2:
            title: Visas
            content: It’s a good idea to look up visa requirements, as each country varies. Make sure you leave plenty of time before your departure to get a visa sorted out if required.
          tip3:
            title: Local Language
            content: It’s always a good idea to learn a bit of the local language before you travel there. It’s also the best way to show your respect towards local people.
          tip4:
            title: Common Sense & Instinct
            content: Having a common sense while traveling is the key. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t do it. Trust your instinct. It’s a good idea always to tell someone you trust (your family or your close friends) where you’re going and what your plans are. We suggest that you send them a copy of your itinerary and local contact number before your departure.
          tip5:
            title: Mobile Phone & SIM Card When You Are Aboard
            content: We recommend that you check out whether your phone will work abroad or if you can pick up a cheap local SIM card when you arrive so you will be able to make phone calls or send texts locally.
          tip6:
            title: Plenty of Contact
            content: Before staying with a hostess or arranging to meet other solo female travelers through the Hangout service we recommend that you have plenty of contact with them beforehand to understand each other’s expectations and preferences.
          tip7:
            title: Vaccinations
            content: We recommend that you check about necessary vaccinations in the area you are travelling to and ensure that your vaccinations are up-to-date.
          tip8:
            title: Have A Backup Plan
            content: In case something doesn’t work out with your hostess in the unexpected circumstances, make sure you have an alternate place to stay. Meanwhile, please report to our Safety Team if such case occurs. Identify the nearest hostel or hotel, or have a backup hostess in place before you go. If possible, research your hostess’s neighborhood prior to arriving. Some of hostesses may offer to pick you up from an airport or a bus/ metro station, but always look up how to get to and from her home on your own in case of change of plan. If you’re heading to an event or joining a Hangout, look up the location prior to attending.
          tip9:
            title: Travel Research
            content: Be sure you’re aware of cultural and religious differences, sensitivities, and general safety recommendations for each place that you travel. Check government websites for travel advice in different countries and do your own research. We recommend you research things such as attitudes towards women, codes of dress, rules on alcohol etc. That way you might avoid making your first ‘faux-pas’ the moment you step off the plane!
          tip10:
            title: Communicate Through La Voyageuse
            content: Use only La Voyageuse website to communicate. Confirming trips and keeping all communication on La Voyageuse helps our Safety Team identify issues and react quickly. Never give out your phone number or email address to anyone outside La Voyageuse website until you meet and feel comfortable with them.
          tip11:
            title: Be Aware of Your Surroundings and Know Your Limits
            content: Stay alert at all times. Avoid dark alleys when you walk home in the night alone. Do not stay out late at night alone. Do not trust people easily. You can enjoy yourself and have some fun but don’t go over the limit and don’t put your safety and well-being in the hands of others.
          tip12:
            title: Leave References
            content: Use the reference system to let others on La Voyageuse know about your experiences with the people you meet. We will also send you a private questionnaire for you to rate your experience in full confidentiality with your hostesses/ travelers after your homesharing experience.
